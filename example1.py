Day 1, Example 1: Taxi Fare Calculator (sequence only) zzz
 
Python version of the pseudocode in Day1_PseudocodeFlowchart_Examples.md.
Written to follow the pseudocode line for line, top to bottom, so the two can
be read side by side. No functions, no loops, no conditions: just sequence.
 
Trace to check: distance_miles = 4, waiting_minutes = 10 gives a fare of 10.80
